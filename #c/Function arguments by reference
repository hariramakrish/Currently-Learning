Pointers to structures

Let's say we want to create a function which moves a point forward in both x and y directions, called move. Instead of sending two pointers, we can now send only one pointer to the function of the point structure:

void move(point * p) {
    (*p).x++;
    (*p).y++;
}

However, if we wish to dereference a structure and access one of it's internal members, we have a shorthand syntax for that, because this operation is widely used in data structures. We can rewrite this function using the following syntax:

void move(point * p) {
    p->x++;
    p->y++;
}
