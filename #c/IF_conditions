Exercise

Let us try to find out the average marks of a group of five students for two subjects, Mathematics and Physics. To do this, we use a two-dimensional array called grades. The marks corresponding to Mathematics would be stored in the first row (grades[0]), whereas those corresponding to Physics would be stored in the second row (grades[1]). Complete the following steps so that you can execute this program.

Declare grades as a two-dimensional array of integers
Complete the for loops by specifying their terminating conditions
Compute the average marks obtained in each subject
