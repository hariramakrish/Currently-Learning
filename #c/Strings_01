1)[strncat()] 

It is part of the C standard library and is included in the <string.h> header file.

The C standard library provides a set of functions to perform common operations on strings, such as copying, concatenating, comparing, and manipulating strings. These functions are not part of the core C language syntax but are available as library functions that can be used by including the relevant header files.

To use strncat() or any other string-related functions in C, you need to include the <string.h> header file in your program. This header file declares the function prototypes and provides the necessary definitions for working with strings.
